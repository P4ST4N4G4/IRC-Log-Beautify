May 07 11:29:02 *	Topic for ##anime set by ImoutoBot (Sun May  4 09:00:00 2025)
May 07 11:29:19 <meidam>	Maybe the Sunlit Man could count as somewhat sci fi at this point
May 07 11:29:23 <omero>	meidam: i recommend patricia mckillip. the harpist trilogy
May 07 11:29:24 <gurrr>	meidam, i'd really really realyl suggest ursulua k leguinn
May 07 11:29:33 <gurrr>	btw i'm the same, i was mostly fantasy too
May 07 11:29:50 <gurrr>	on that note.. i gotta wonder if they can do neuromancer justice at apple for a tv version of it
May 07 11:29:50 <omero>	its totally fantasy and its almost as good as tolkien
May 07 11:29:59 <omero>	but shorter
May 07 11:30:02 <gurrr>	is tolkein actually good though?
May 07 11:30:06 *	Ghostfeint (~Ghostfein@2603:6080:3901:1acd:a895:8ee6:4e6c:7172) has joined
May 07 11:30:07 <gurrr>	i mean it's not like bad
May 07 11:30:42 <gurrr>	yeah i wouldn't say they are bad books.. it just felt kind of simplistic in retrospect 
May 07 11:30:51 <Ingvix>	the hobbit was pretty boring
May 07 11:30:54 <omero>	gurrr: im going to ignore your orchish rudeness
May 07 11:31:43 <omero>	Ingvix: got up the wrong side of the bed ... again?
May 07 11:31:44 <gurrr>	i wanna see if somebody can actually give me the neuromancer i wanna see.. it'll be interesting
May 07 11:32:05 <gurrr>	I was hoping they'd do better by the wheel of time at amazon.. but it's too rushed :(
May 07 11:32:29 <gurrr>	it needed that budget spread out amongst waaay more episodes than  way more fancy stuff and smaller episodes
May 07 11:32:35 <omero>	oh philip pullman just announced completing his 'book of dust' trilogy
May 07 11:32:39 <gurrr>	I mean heck.. look at what battlestar galactica did
May 07 11:33:14 <Bco1981>	which one
May 07 11:33:15 <omero>	they cast tricia helfer. wont complain about that
May 07 11:33:26 <gurrr>	although to be fair.. most of it was set in pretty constrained areas
May 07 11:34:00 *	mnrmnaugh (~mnrmnaugh@static-100-0-45-12.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined
May 07 11:34:04 <meidam>	omero: I somehow expected that the harpist trilogy would be scifi since we were talking about scifi, but it looks really fantasy to me
May 07 11:34:24 <omero>	but .. ok im ancient enough to have seen the original bsg... then watched the reimagined bsg... was good for about 1 and a half seasons .. then it ... derailed
May 07 11:34:52 <gurrr>	did you actually like the original though? 
May 07 11:34:54 *	Ghostfeint has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
May 07 11:34:59 <gurrr>	I'm sure it was "fine" 
May 07 11:35:15 <omero>	meidam: you said you're more into fantasy. and suddenly it triggered ... the harpist memories
May 07 11:35:18 <mnrmnaugh>	NEXT TIME, ON DRAGONBALL BSG
May 07 11:35:24 <mnrmnaugh>	NOTHING HAPPENS
May 07 11:35:30 <gurrr>	I have some criticisms of some of the episodes .. but overall it gave me what i wanted to see
May 07 11:35:35 <meidam>	omero: Ah okay
May 07 11:35:38 <gurrr>	i didn't care for the ending though
May 07 11:35:39 <omero>	gurrr: can you forget about cassiopea?
May 07 11:35:50 <mnrmnaugh>	first season was decent, the new one
May 07 11:36:04 <meidam>	Looks like the books are quite short, so I guess I could put them on the list. But I probably won't
May 07 11:36:04 <omero>	the ending of the reimagined was just ... painful
May 07 11:36:31 <meidam>	gurrr: Are there any specific books by ursula k le guin that you recommend?
May 07 11:36:34 <omero>	as in bad to endure, gurrr 
May 07 11:36:58 <gurrr>	meidam, i'm trying to remember if you can read "the dispossessed" standalone.. i think you can
May 07 11:37:22 <gurrr>	at least according to ursula herself and my mom who read it as her first book
May 07 11:37:36 <gurrr>	first leguinn book
May 07 11:37:38 <Ingvix>	books are gay
May 07 11:37:39 <meidam>	An ambiguous utopia, interesting
May 07 11:37:43 *	Sasazuka (~Sasazuka@user/sasazuka) has joined
May 07 11:37:43 *	ImoutoBot welcomes S​asazuka (9 / 36): [18:26] <S​asazuka> so many questions | [18:26] <S​asazuka> why is your keyboard at penis leve​l? | [18:27] <S​asazuka> why would you aim your penis at your keyboard
May 07 11:37:50 <gurrr>	I imagine you might like more than a few of them
May 07 11:38:30 <meidam>	For some reason it says "Hainish Cycle #6" above it https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=wZzviG9dar&rank=1
May 07 11:38:31 <ImoutoBot>	[title] The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia by Ursula K. Le Guin | Goodreads
May 07 11:38:56 <meidam>	Are the 5 books before it prequels then?
May 07 11:39:01 *	Sasazuka has quit (Client Quit)
May 07 11:39:15 <meidam>	Nah, they were written before it
May 07 11:39:38 <meidam>	Ah, you meant your mom's first le guin book
May 07 11:40:54 <meidam>	But okay, if you say that it can be read standalone, then I guess it can
May 07 11:41:24 <gurrr>	meidam, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainish_Cycle check the "LeGuin's view" section for her view
May 07 11:41:24 <ImoutoBot>	[title] Hainish Cycle - Wikipedia
May 07 11:42:24 <sscout>	the video editing on this is great <3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgo4ABCydAk
May 07 11:42:26 <ImoutoBot>	[youtube] Playing SOLO LEVELING SONGS On Piano In PUBLIC! | Duration: 6 minutes, 13 seconds
May 07 11:42:26 <gurrr>	she suggests reading them in written order, but not because they really connect
May 07 11:42:52 <gurrr>	if you wanna read the earlier ones first, go ahead . you probably won't be disappointed
May 07 11:46:16 <omero>	when you say '' books are gay '' Ingvix ... what you mean exactly. please elaborate.
May 07 11:47:38 <gurrr>	I imagine he's alluded to the idea that manly men do not read books and thus books are gay. I do think it was in jest.
May 07 11:48:06 <omero>	let him elaborate, gurrr 
May 07 11:48:20 <gurrr>	i'm sure if he feels like it.. he will. 
May 07 11:48:26 <gurrr>	i'm just guessing
May 07 11:48:37 <omero>	speculating.
May 07 11:48:58 <Ingvix>	let's not let him elaborate
May 07 11:49:26 <meidam>	gurrr: Okay, seems like le guin's fans care more about coherence than she toes
May 07 11:49:34 <meidam>	s/toes/does
May 07 11:49:52 <gurrr>	the one who is not fun at parties is accusing other people of not being fun at parties
May 07 11:50:00 <gurrr>	hilarious
May 07 11:50:01 <meidam>	And seems like she would read at least 3 books before the dispossessed because they were written first
May 07 11:50:24 <gurrr>	nobody likes a pedant.  (ask me how i know) 
May 07 11:50:32 *	mnrmnaugh has quit (Quit: Client closed)
May 07 11:50:55 <gurrr>	being a computer nerd makes one extremely prone to pedantry 
May 07 11:51:00 <Ingvix>	how do you know
May 07 11:51:44 <gurrr>	because i used to be much more of an annoying over pedantic computer nerd. now i'm just less so :)
May 07 11:51:57 <Ingvix>	maybe I should try this pedantry at some point
May 07 11:52:17 <gurrr>	i think you already got enough going on. .i don't think you need to expand your uhmm "bits"
May 07 11:52:18 <meidam>	I like knitting and dancing and I baked cookies yesterday, and I'm straight. In case you would like to know. I don't know why you would though
May 07 11:52:35 <omero>	those who read The Hobbit will know what a Troll is
May 07 11:52:50 <Ingvix>	I don't have that much going on
May 07 11:52:59 <gurrr>	well it's still enough
May 07 11:53:07 <Ingvix>	maybe for you
May 07 11:53:14 <gurrr>	and for many other people 
May 07 11:53:29 <gurrr>	but uhmm good luck if you feel like you absolutely must
May 07 11:53:44 *	repoman has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
May 07 11:54:06 <meidam>	I've read the Hobbit, and that one was hard enough for me to get through, so I will most likely not read the lord of the rings, even though I have it...
May 07 11:54:16 <Ingvix>	they may settle for less but I thrive to ever greater heights
May 07 11:54:34 <meidam>	which I guess is kinda sad
May 07 11:54:56 <Ingvix>	yeah, the hobbit was quite bland
May 07 11:55:03 <omero>	meidam: the hobbit was in origin conceived for kids.
May 07 11:55:04 <Ingvix>	perhaps less some when it was published
May 07 11:55:26 <meidam>	omero: Yes, I know. Which is why I imagine that it's easier to get through than the lord of the rings
May 07 11:55:45 <omero>	not really.
May 07 11:55:59 <meidam>	And it's not that I can't read long books. I've read all of Stormlight Archive
